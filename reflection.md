Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Here are the methods that I overload:
Cafe:
printInventory()
restock()

House:
nResidents()
hasDiningRoom()


Library
isAvailable()
containsTitle()

All these methods either do not accept any pass-in value or could be confusing sometimes for users to figure out accepted data type, so I override them that even if you put in the wrong data type, you will still get some message reminding you that.

Everthing worked really smoothly this time, because I understand A6 pretty well. I suggest others should also take a look at their A6 before doing this.
